                                        For community detection, Exponential Random Graph Model(ERGM), Modularity maximization,
                                        Stochastic Block model(SBM) with latent space, Degree-corrected Stochastic
                                        Block model(DCSBM), and Stochastic Block model Mixture of a finite mixture(MFM-SBM)
                                        were used. The report's primary focus will be capturing the differences between
                                        various methodologies of detecting communities in the networks and underlying
                                        assumptions of these methods. As well as understanding, application on real data
                                        needs to be done. Applying algorithms to famous" Zachary Karate Club" data was
                                        preceded before applying algorithms to real-world data. After that, to grasp the
                                        differences between multiple community detection algorithms on the perceivable
                                        level beyond the analytic level, algorithms were deployed for unstructured data
                                        such as images. For image, color distribution similarity and structural similarity
                                        were utilized to construct the network within the artworks, with the color histograms
                                        and the vectors obtained through the trained feature map of convolutional neural
                                        network.</div>
